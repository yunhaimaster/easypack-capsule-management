# Prisma Accelerate Configuration Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-11-01  
**Context**: After upgrading Prisma Accelerate plan, optimizing connection and timeout settings

---

## 📊 Current Settings

Based on your Prisma Accelerate dashboard:

| Setting | Current Value | Recommendation | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| **Connection Pool Size** | 10 (fixed) | ✅ Keep as-is | Already sufficient with batching |
| **Response Size** | 5 MiB | ✅ Keep as-is | Too large = slower queries + higher costs |
| **Query Duration** | 10s | ⚠️ **Increase to 20s** | Some complex queries take longer |
| **Transaction Duration** | 15s | ⚠️ **Increase to 30s** | Better for complex operations |

---

## 🔧 Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Query Duration: **10s → 20s** ⚠️ RECOMMENDED

**Why**:
- Complex queries with multiple `include` relations can take 2-8 seconds
- Recipe library queries with JSONB filtering can be slow
- AI operations with database lookups need headroom
- Batch operations (especially scheduling status checks) benefit from more time

**What to Change**:
Move the slider to **20s**

**Impact**:
- ✅ Prevents timeout errors on complex queries
- ✅ Better user experience for heavy operations
- ⚠️ Still reasonable - won't block other queries indefinitely

---

### 2. Transaction Duration: **15s → 30s** ⚠️ RECOMMENDED

**Why**:
- Complex multi-step operations (bulk updates, imports)
- Large data transformations during migrations
- Export operations that query and format data
- Better safety margin for edge cases

**What to Change**:
Move the slider to **30s**

**Impact**:
- ✅ More reliable for bulk operations
- ✅ Prevents transaction rollbacks on complex updates
- ✅ Better support for data import/export features

---

### 3. Response Size: **5 MiB** ✅ KEEP

**Why**:
- Your queries are well-optimized with `select` to fetch only needed fields
- Large JSONB fields (recipe ingredients) should be paginated, not fetched all at once
- Increasing this would make queries slower and increase costs

**What to Change**:
❌ **Don't change** - Keep at 5 MiB

---

### 4. Connection Pool Size: **10** ✅ SUFFICIENT

**Why**:
- ✅ Batching architecture implemented (80+ requests → 1 request)
- ✅ Connection pool no longer exhausted
- ✅ Even with 20+ users, batching keeps connections low

**What to Change**:
❌ **Can't change** (fixed by Prisma for your plan)
✅ **Don't need to** - Architecture already optimized

---

## 📊 Expected Performance Impact

### Before Optimization:
```
Complex Query: 12 seconds → TIMEOUT ❌
Batch Operations: 18 seconds → TIMEOUT ❌  
Export: 25 seconds → TIMEOUT ❌
```

### After Optimization:
```
Complex Query: 12 seconds → SUCCESS ✅
Batch Operations: 18 seconds → SUCCESS ✅
Export: 25 seconds → SUCCESS ✅
```

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Action Items**:
1. ✅ Query Duration: **10s → 20s** (Move slider in Accelerate settings)
2. ✅ Transaction Duration: **15s → 30s** (Move slider in Accelerate settings)  
3. ✅ Response Size: Keep at **5 MiB**
4. ✅ Connection Pool: Keep at **10** (fixed, already sufficient)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Fewer timeout errors
- Better reliability for complex operations
- No performance degradation
- No additional costs (settings changes don't affect pricing)

---

## 🔍 Testing After Changes

After updating Accelerate settings, test:
1. ✅ Load `/work-orders` with 50+ PRODUCTION rows (should use batch endpoint)
2. ✅ Complex recipe searches with JSONB filtering
3. ✅ Export operations (PDF generation)
4. ✅ Bulk operations in work orders
5. ✅ AI features that query database for context

## 📝 Notes

### Connection Pool FAQ

**Q: Should I upgrade to get more connections?**  
**A**: Not necessary. With batching (1 request vs 80+ requests), 10 connections is more than enough. Only upgrade if you expect 50+ simultaneous users.

**Q: What if I see connection errors anyway?**  
**A**: Check if batching is working:
- Look for `POST /api/manager-scheduling/check-batch` in logs
- Should see 1 batch request, not 80 individual requests
- If still seeing many individual requests, there's a bug in batching logic

### Timeout Settings FAQ

**Q: Why not set timeout to maximum (60s)?**  
**A**: Too long = stuck queries block resources for others. 20s is sweet spot: long enough for complex queries, short enough to fail fast.

**Q: Will this affect costs?**  
**A**: No. Query duration limits don't affect billing. Only query volume matters.
