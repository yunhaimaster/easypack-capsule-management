### 2. 📋 Version Control Workflow

**Branch Naming Conventions:**
```bash
feature/add-recipe-search
fix/authentication-timeout
refactor/unify-card-components
docs/update-api-guide
perf/optimize-database-queries
test/add-e2e-authentication
```

**Pull Request Process:**
- PR template with description, changes, testing checklist
- Code review checklist (design system, types, performance, etc.)
- Merge strategy (squash and merge for features)
- When to create PR vs direct commit

**Git Commit Best Practices:**
- Emoji-based commit messages (✨ feat, 🐛 fix, ♻️ refactor, etc.)
- Multi-line commit format for complex changes
- Clear, descriptive messages

**GitHub MCP Integration:**

### 3. 📊 Performance Benchmarks

**Target Metrics:**
- Initial Load: < 3 seconds (3G connection)
- Subsequent Pages: < 1 second
- API Response: < 500ms average
- AI Streaming: First token < 1s
- First Load JS: < 200KB

**Lighthouse Scores (Minimum):**
- Performance: > 90
- Accessibility: > 95
- Best Practices: > 95
- SEO: > 90

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Build time > 5 minutes
- Bundle size increase > 20% in single PR
- LCP > 3 seconds for 3 consecutive deploys
- API error rate > 5%
- Database query > 1 second

**Monitoring:**
- Vercel Analytics (already integrated)

**Performance Debugging:**
- If load time > 3s: Check bundle size, implement code splitting
- If API slow: Add indexes, implement caching
- If AI slow: Reduce tokens, use faster model, show streaming

---

### 4. 🔍 Error Logging & Monitoring

**What to Log:**
- ✅ API failures, database errors, auth failures
- ✅ AI model errors and fallbacks
- ✅ Unhandled exceptions
- ❌ Passwords, API keys, PII

**Log Levels:**
- CRITICAL: System down, data loss
- ERROR: Feature broken, needs immediate fix
- WARN: Degraded performance, fallback active
- INFO: Important events, state changes
- DEBUG: Development only

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- Standard try-catch with context logging
- AI-specific error handling with fallbacks
- User-friendly error messages (Traditional Chinese)

**Alert Configuration:**
- Critical: Immediate notification
- High Priority: 15-minute delay
- Medium Priority: 1-hour aggregation

**Acceptable Error Rates:**
- Overall: < 2%
- API: < 1%
- AI: < 5% (with fallbacks)
- Build: < 1%
