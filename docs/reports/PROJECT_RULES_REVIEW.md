### Error Logging Strategy

#### What to Log
- API errors with request context
- Database query failures
- AI model errors and fallbacks
- Authentication failures
- Validation errors (aggregated)
- Performance issues (> 2x normal time)

#### Where to Log
- Development: Console (verbose)
- Production: Vercel Logs (errors only)
- User-facing: Toast notifications
- Analytics: Vercel Analytics

#### Error Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System down, data loss
- **High**: Feature broken, security issue

### Error Handling Patterns
```typescript
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  // Log with context
  console.error('[Module] Operation failed', {
    error,
    context: { userId, orderId },
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  
  // Show user-friendly message
  toast.error('操作失敗，請重試')
  
  // Track in analytics
  trackError('operation_failed', { module, error })
}
```
```

---

### 4. Accessibility Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status**: ⚠️ Requirements Defined, Testing Procedures Missing

**Needed:**
```markdown
### Accessibility Testing Procedures

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Esc)
- [ ] Focus visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader announces content correctly
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1)
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Forms have labels
- [ ] Errors announced to screen readers

#### Screen Reader Testing
- macOS: VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
- Windows: NVDA (free)
- Test critical user flows

#### Automated Testing
```bash
# Lighthouse accessibility audit
npm run lighthouse

# axe-core in development
# (already integrated if using Chrome DevTools)
```

#### Color Contrast Validation
- Tool: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- Check: text-neutral-800 on bg-white
- Check: button text on button background
- Check: all semantic colors

#### Focus State Validation
- All interactive elements show focus ring
- Focus ring is 2px solid rgba(42, 150, 209, 0.6)
- Focus ring visible on all backgrounds
```

---

### 5. Database Migration Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Status**: ⚠️ Forward Migration Documented, Rollback Missing

**Needed:**
```markdown
### Database Migration Rollback Procedure

#### Development Rollback
```bash
# Reset to previous state
npx prisma migrate reset

# Or rollback last migration manually
# Delete migration folder
# Edit _prisma_migrations table
```

#### Production Rollback
```bash
# CAUTION: Only if absolutely necessary

# Step 1: Stop all deployments
# Step 2: Create database backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

# Step 3: Manually rollback migration
# Write reverse migration SQL
# Apply carefully

# Step 4: Update Prisma schema
# Remove new fields/models

# Step 5: Generate new client
npx prisma generate

# Step 6: Deploy fixed version
```

#### Migration Testing Before Production
1. Test migration on staging database
2. Verify data integrity
3. Test rollback procedure
4. Time the migration (should be < 5 minutes)
5. Document any manual steps required
6. Get approval before production deployment

#### Breaking Change Migrations
1. Add new field as optional first
2. Deploy application update
3. Backfill data if needed
4. Make field required in next migration
5. Never rename fields directly (add new + migrate data + remove old)
```

---

### 6. Environment Management (LOW PRIORITY)

**Status**: ⚠️ Variables Documented, Switching Not

**Needed:**
```markdown
### Environment Management

#### Environment Variable Validation
```typescript
// src/lib/env.ts
const envSchema = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  OPENROUTER_API_KEY: z.string().min(1),
  LOGIN: z.string().min(1),
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(['development', 'production', 'test'])
})

// Validate on startup
const env = envSchema.parse(process.env)
```

#### Local Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone [repo-url]

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# 4. Configure environment variables
# Edit .env.local with your values

# 5. Initialize database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev

# 6. Seed database (optional)
npm run seed

# 7. Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Environment Switching
- Development: Uses .env.local
- Production: Uses Vercel environment variables
- Testing: Uses .env.test (if exists)

Never commit:
- .env.local
- .env
- .env.*.local
```

---

## Rule Consistency Check

### Cross-Rule Validation

#### ✅ Consistent Rules
- Design system + iOS design → Both enforce Apple HIG standards
- AI optimization + Development workflow → Both emphasize quality over speed
- Security + Database → Both enforce environment variable usage
- Form validation + API responses → Both use Zod schemas

#### ⚠️ Potential Inconsistencies
1. **Component Size Limit**
   - Workspace rule: "Max 250 lines per component"
   - User rule: "Black box architecture" (may require larger modules)
   - **Resolution**: Apply 250-line limit to UI components, allow larger for business logic modules with clear boundaries

2. **Code Editing Philosophy**
   - User rule: "Write code that never needs editing"
   - Workspace rule: "Refactoring encouraged"
   - **Resolution**: Already addressed in analysis - apply to interfaces vs implementations
